During my time at [Israel Tech Challenge (ITC)](https://www.itc.tech/), my responsibilities included giving lectures on various data science topics, writing coding exercises, and helping students through their studies.

Topics that I have taught include:
* Classical machine learning (classification and regression algorithms, unsupervised learning, ...)
* Introduction to deep learning
* Keras and TensorFlow
* Natural language processing and computer vision

I also served as the students' advisor as they work on their final data science projects, including writing online articles describing their work. Projects that my students have produced include:
