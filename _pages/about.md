I am a PhD student at the [School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University (TAU)](https://en-engineering.tau.ac.il/School-of-Electrical-Engineering/main). Under the mentorship of [Dr. Hadar Averbuch-Elor](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hadarelor/), I am researching *multimodal learning* â€“ machine learning applied to tasks involving vision and language.

I received my MSc with honors from Tel Aviv University in Computer Science and my BSc from MIT with a dual major in mathematics and linguistics. My prior employment experience includes work as a data scientist in the industry, focusing on applications of natural language processing, as well as lecturing and designing learning materials on topics including classical machine learning and deep learning as the Tech Lead at [Israel Tech Challenge (ITC)](https://www.itc.tech/).
