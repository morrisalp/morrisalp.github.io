I am an MSc student at the [Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University (TAU)](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/computer). Under the mentorship of [Dr. Hadar Averbuch-Elor](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hadarelor/), I am researching *multimodal learning* â€“ machine learning applied to tasks involving vision and language. I am also collaborating with [Dr. Shai Gordin](https://ariel.academia.edu/ShaiGordin) of Ariel University in the [Digital Pasts Lab](https://digitalpasts.github.io/), applying natural language processing and computer vision to understanding ancient texts.

I also work for [Israel Tech Challenge (ITC)](https://www.itc.tech/) in the Fellows Data Science program, serving as the Tech Lead and as a lecturer. I design the syllabus and teaching materials based on my previous industry experience as a data scientist as well as insights from my academic career. I give lectures on topics including classical machine learning and deep learning, and mentor students as they complete their data science final projects.

I received by B.Sc. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a dual major in mathematics and linguistics. My prior employment experience includes work as a data scientist in the industry, focusing on applications of natural language processing.
