I am an MSc student at the [Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/computer). Under the mentorship of [Dr. Hadar Averbuch-Elor](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hadarelor/), I am researching *multimodal learning* â€“ machine learning applied to tasks involving vision and language. I am also collaborating with [Dr. Shai Gordin](https://ariel.academia.edu/ShaiGordin) of Ariel University in the [Digital Pasts Lab](https://digitalpasts.github.io/), applying natural language processing and computer vision to understanding ancient texts.

Alongside my academic pursuits, I work for [Israel Tech Challenge (ITC)](https://www.itc.tech/) in the Fellows Data Science program, serving as the Tech Lead and as a lecturer. I design the syllabus and teaching materials based on my prior industry experience as a data scientist as well as insights from my academic career.
